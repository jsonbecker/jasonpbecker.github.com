<li>Higher demand, higher quantity.</li>
<li>Cost differences between levels impacts provision by level.

    <h2>Proposition 1</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <blockquote>
<p>&quot;The quantity of goods provided by a grant-receiving government increases in 
proportion to the size of the grant received. The effect of the grant is greater in
regions where the costs of good provision are low, and where the subnational 
government is inefficient in raising taxes, relative to the national government.&quot;&quot;</p>

    <h2>Proposition 2</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <blockquote>
<p>&quot;All else equal, subnational governments will accept grants when: (a) the policy 
constraints imposed in the grant conditions are small, (b) the size of the grant is 
large, (c) the subnational government is not able to raise taxes efficiently, (d) 
the cost of good provision are large, and (e) public demand is low.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(e) is a pretty weird finding. Grants are less likely to be accepted if demand is low? The rationale provided is that subnational governments don&#39;t want to share credit where demand is sufficiently high.</p>

    <h2>Flypaper Effect Revisited</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <p>We found that IGG increases spending:
\[\frac{g(2\alpha_{N}-\alpha_{S})}{2m_{s}\alpha_{N}}\]</p>

<ul class = "build">
<li>An income effect would say \(\frac{g}{m_{S}}\).</li>
<li>This is only true when \(\alpha_{s}=0\) in the result.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implications</h3>

<ul class = "build">
<li>Stronger flypaper effect where the efficiency of state government to raise taxes is low.</li>
<li>However, we also found (Proposition 3) that the national government provides IGGs in areas where the subnational government would likely increase spending anyway, which would look like a flypaper effect.</li>

<li>Some conditions lead both governments to change provisions in the same direction

<li>demand</li>
<li>cost</li>

<li>Others may lead to inverse relationships

<ul>
<li>tax efficiency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Implications</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If a grant program is establihsed in response to increased public demand in a given program area, but cut back or abandoned in response to a decrease in the national government&#39;s relative ability to raise taxes, then such an asymmetric response to changing grant conditions might occur.&quot;</p>
