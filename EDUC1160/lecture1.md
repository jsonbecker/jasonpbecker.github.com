## The President Loves You

"The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too 
small, but whether it works â€” whether it helps families find jobs at a decent 
wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is 
yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end."

President Barack Obama, January 20, 2009
